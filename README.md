> Repository: https://github.com/Burdulaa/Workshop-11

## Overview

Workshop-11 is a small multi-page static website built with HTML and CSS.  
It consists of a main page and a separate details page, with shared styling and image assets.  
The project focuses on practising:

- Multi-page layout structure
- Consistent styling across pages
- Using a CSS reset plus a custom stylesheet
- Working with images via a dedicated asset folder

Everything is static and runs entirely in the browser.

## Features

- Main page: `index.html`
- Secondary page: `details.html` (for more detailed content)
- Global CSS reset in `reset.css` to normalise browser defaults
- Custom layout and styling in `style.css`
- Local image assets stored in the `images/` folder
- Pure front-end: HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript, no backend)

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
